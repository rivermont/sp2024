### Clean Water Act

#### Mar 18, 2024

Clean Water Act regulates via command-and-control

- regulates point- and non-point-source pollution

Point-source: pollution effluent is discharged from a single point
Non-point source: Diffused sourced of pollution (runoff, agricultural infilitrating groundwater)

Contaminates:

- thermal water pollution (heated coolant water discharged into waterways)
- suspended solids
- dissolved oxygen
- disease

CWA Focus Areas:

- point source pollution
- plan of regulatino for non-pllution
- water quality standard for waterways
- also restricts dredging and filling of wetlands

CWA administration power is given to states for:

- assigning water usages (what is the primary use? drinking, swimming, fishing)
- establishing water quality standards (WQS)
- monitoring compliance
- manage pollutant discharges to meet these standards

WQS

- designated use
- criteria (max pollutant concentrations, or narrative ie "free from xx"
- antidegredation policy (WHAT IS THIS?)

NPDES permit

- required for all pollutant discharge activity
- valid for 5 years
- two approaches to manage water pollutants:
  - treat pollution at point source
  - change upstream process to reduce pollution

Industrial Point Source

- government assigns a numeric effluent limitation and industry is free to meet the limitation in any way
- ie. total max daily load (TMDL)

Technology-based standards (BPT, BCT, BAT, BACT)

Existing point sources regulation:

- Conventional pollutants (DO, SS, pH, fecal coliform, bacteria, oil and grease)
- Toxic pollutants (126 listed chemicals)
- Non-conventional pollutants

Indirect discharge:

- Discharges into municipal wastewater and stormwater systems

Non-point sources:

- pollution control from agriculture, mining, etc
- state and EPA can do almost nothing
- EPA sec 319: must create "best management practices"

### Mar 20, 2024

Water Quality Trading Programs

- landowners can implement programs that extract pollution from the environment
- pollutors can buy pollution credits from the landowners
- net cost savings in the system
- net benefit to environment

Actors:

- Regulated Facilities
- Landowners
- Certificates

#### Clean Water Act

##### Sarah and Forest

Amendments

- 1977: set technology-based standards to reduce toxic pollutants
- 1981 revision: started municipal construction grant process
- 1987: created process for permitting and enforcing stornwater discharge systems (toxic sludge control, storm sewer system requirements)
- 2000 revision: reduced amount of discharge in water systems from CSOs

Water Quality Act of 1987

- created Clean Water State Revolving Fund
- helps federal-state connection for planning water quality projects

Great Lakes Critical Programs Act 1990

- signed by US (with Canada) to reduce toxic pollutants in great lakes

Wet Weather Water Quality Act 2000

BEACH Act 2000

- Created a grant program to promote monitoring of coastal waterways and reduce waterborne diseases for recreation

##### Court Cases

Sackett vs. EPA (Sackett II)

- private citizen filling wetlands on his land
- EPA fined him for violating the CWA
- citizen took EPA to court, won unanimously
- court opinion redefined WOTUS definition, removed wetlands and groundwater connections

Maui v. Hawaii Wildlife Fund

- county wastewater plant using groundwater injection
- found to be polluting ocean, beaches, and coral death
- court found that point source discharges to WOTUS through groundwater are regulated by CWA
- "functional equivalent" of a direct discharge

Yadkin Riverkeeper v. Duke Energy

- coal ash pond leaked 27 million gals into Yadkin River
- Duke pled guilty to 9 counts of CWA violation
- revealed numerous other violations around the state
- $68 million criminal fine and $24 million towards remediation effort

LA Flood Control vs. Nat. Res. Defense Council (2013)

- LA stormwater repeatedly reported unacceptable levels of pollutants in their MS4 flood control channels
- questioned whether divertion channels should be considered point-source of pollution
- SCOTUS ruled in favor of LA Flood Control: since pollution could be coming from upstream, it's not the responsibility of the flood authority

### Clean Air Regulation

#### Mar 25, 2024

Major achievements:

- Lead emissions reduced
- Air quality overall much better

Problems:

- Large cities are still not in compliance
- Smog and particulate matter still problems

Pollutant graphs have sloped down but are flattening, but we have also increased GDP and production

Trillions of dollars savings from CAA:

- mostly healthcare cost savings
- also energy efficiency from newer technology

What does CAA regulate?

- key pollutant list
- pollutant thresholds set at "level that protects public health"
- tail-pipe reduction vs. source reductions
- set standards (command and control) and market based solutions

NAAQS Criteria Pollutants:

- Ozone (O3)
- Nitrous Oxide (NOx)
- Carbon monoxide (CO)
- Fine particles (PM)
- Sulphur dioxide (SO2)
- Lead (Pb)

Ground-level ozone created through chemical reactions with NOx, VOCs, and sunlight

NAAQS:

- Air quality standards are not based on economic or technical feasibility, only health aspects
- Primary target is protecting human health
- Secondary target is protecting public welfare including wildlife, water, and visibility

State Implementation Plans (SIPs)

Air Quality Management process

- inventory of current emissions
- discuss strategies for emissions control
- demonstrate through modeling that SIP will satisfy NAAQS levels
- EPA approves or suggests modifications to SIP
- state implements SIP and monitors air quality

EPA designates nonattainment areas based on air quality monitoring
EPA establishes Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) and imposes restrictions on pollutors
Difficult to control land use

Grandfathered Sources

- older pollution sources that existed before CAA
- abide by looser standards than new pollutor construction
  - New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new pollutor construction

Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD)

- air quality doesn't drop below NAAQS
- Class I protection: National Parks
- Class II protection: other areas

Mobile emissions sources

- regulated by EPA because interstate travel

### Toxic Substance Management

#### Health-based Statutes

- Zero-risk approach
- banning food additives

#### Feasibility Studies

- reduce health risk to what is "feasible"
- Benzene case: allowed in a "safe workplace" to the "extent feasible"
- SDWA: "maximum contaminant level goals"

#### Risk-Benefit Statutes

- Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act
  - new pesticides must register with EPA
- EPA determines the information provide by manufacturer, and assesses "unreasonable risk" when used with safe practices

Toxic Substances Control Act

#### Informational Approach

- public pressure and market choices address the problem
- CA Prop 65: if selling a product with a listed chemical (900), must disclose that there is a risk of cancer etc.

### Wed, Apr 3 2024

Resource Conservation and Reclamation Act (RCRA)

Listed waste is listed in CFR

- Waste > solid waste > hazardous solid waste
- labeling, packaging, reporting requirements for hazardous waste

Waste prevention:

- landfill tax

Circular economy

- zero end waste manufacturing/recycling processes

### Environmental Permitting

### Thapa, April 10th

#### Air Permits

CAA Title V Permits:

- any construction or major modification of "major sources" needs permit first
  - major sources have potential emissions above the threshold
- source threshold is 100 ton/yr for any air pollutants
- hazardous air pollutants are 10 ton/yr for for single HAP or 25 ton/yr for combinations of HAP
- Non-attainment areas have lower thresholds because they're already not meeting requirements

Industry-specific permitting actions

- wood pellet industry
- natural gas compressor stations
- asphalt plants

#### Water Permits

National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)

- under Clean Water Act
- permit required for all discharge to WOTUS
- five years validity
- permit not needed if discharging to municipal system, but the municipality may have its own requirements

Industrial Point Source

- TMDL limit assigned, pollutor is free to meet that limit in any manner
- end-of-pipe technology vs. industrial process modification

### Landuse Regulation
Calthorpe's Seven Ideas
(combating sprawl, which creates isolated groups)
1. Preserve natural ecologies, agrarian landscapes, and cultural heritage sites
2. Mixed-use and mixed-income neighborhoods
3. Walkable streets and human-scale neighborhoods
4. Prioritize bicycle networks and auto-free streets
5. Connect: Increase density of road network, limit block size
6. Ride: develop high quality transit and affordable BRT
7. Focus: Match density and mix to transit capacity
