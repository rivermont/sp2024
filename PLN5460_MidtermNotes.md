Market-based vs non-market based environmental policies

Non-market based:
- setting regulation limits on emissions, etc
- R&D subsidies

Market based:
- Taxes
- Trading schemes (cap and trade)
- Feed-in tariffs (credit for feeding solar back to grid)
- Deposit and refund (cans and bottles)

Branches and levels of government:
- Executive, legislative, judicial
- Federal, state, local

Policy actions before 1970:
- based on sustained use and multifunctional use

Policy actions from 1970 to 2023
- establishment of EPA
- NEPA (requirement of environmental assessment for new projects)
- Clean Air Act
- Clean Water Act

Reagan 1980s:
- reduction in power of EPA
- budget cuts for environmental programs
- agency appointments
- shifting environmental responsibilities from federal to the states and private
- but also some good amendments to Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts

Bush Sr.:
- creation of US Global Change Research Program
- research into climate change globally

Air quality legislation has not largely improved since the 1970s; some local improvements

Water quality legislation has not improved
Sackett 2023 ruling

Point-source pollution has been attacked strongly
Non point-source pollution (agriculture) have not been targeted successfully

New water quality challenges:
- microplastics
- PFAS forever chemicals

##### Daly

Economies are a subset of the biosphere;all systems are built on a foundation which is ecology and biodiversity

Steady-state economy:
- using GDP as a measure of growth is unsustainable; it is a limited resource
- at some point GDP will plateau and we will need a steady-state that sustains itself
- Instead of focusing on economy, focus on quality of living

Economy operating in empty vs full world

Economic limits
Ecological limits

Limits to the regenerative capacity

Alernatives:
- different metrics than GDP
- happiness indices
- including environmental resources into metrics like GDP

Economic imperialism: expanding the economy to the max capacity of the ecosystem

As society has grown, complexity on the global scale increasing

Change patterns need to happen in certain sectors
Drivers of change are cultural, political, education

Industrial ecology

Greenification at all levels of the industrial process

State Governments' Role in Environmental Protection Policy

Sectors where states dominate protections

waste management

groundwater

landuse

transportation

energy production and electric regulation

Innovative policies

Stringent policies

states implementing stricter policy than federal (ie. CA emissions)

pollution control

Filling the void from federal law

Greenhouse gas regulation

Problems with state regulation

spillover effect

contradicting, adjacent states

weakening of existing policies

transboundary resources (aquifer)

#### 29 Jan 2024

Before CAWA (1970s), two common law doctrines were mostly what regulated environmental pollution

Nuisance

Trespass

Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur case

Problems with common law doctrines:

state has to bring a public nuisance suit

Prescriptive Regulation

technology-based standards

performance-based standards

Property Rights

one way to combat the tragedy of the commons is to privatize the commons

Elinor Ostrom: local communities are just as good at resource management compared to privatization

Ecosystem Services Framework

Financial Penalties

carbon tax etc.

Persuasion

negative environmental publicity, affects the company public image

environmental certifications, required labeling

Corporate Social Responsibility

socially-driven change: gluten free labeling, BPA free, fair trade labeling. Not required but the market made a change

used when passing stronger regulation is difficult

used when we want a behavioral change but maybe without deliverables

Judicial Branch

Prior to 1970:

Courts were primary mechanism for settling environmental disputes; not much existing legislation

often used Property Power and Interstate Commerce clauses of Constitution

1979 - Kleppe v Sierra Club

environmental impact statements

mining company wanted to make plans, Sierra Club wanted them to make an EIS

1976 - Union Electric Co vs EPA

Clean Air Act

Company didn't meet standards for air quality report

court sided with EPA

1978 Adamo Wreckin Co vs US

demolition company releasing asbestos

court decided that because it was demolition, did not meet requirements to fall under CAA

1985 US v Riverside Homes Inc

building adjacent to wetland

loss for groundwater protections

1992 - Lucas v SC Coastal

Land rights issue

Wanted to build on barrier island, law was passed to block building on barrier islands

Required just compensation because his land value dropped

1995 Babbitt v Sweet Home

established 'intent to harm' in ESA includes intent to damage habitat

1996

Federal Courts role is to ease drastic changes in policy

2001 Whitman v American Trucking Assoc

Trucking argues EPA Should have accounted for implementation costs

Whitman tasked with revising NAAQ

Lower court ruled that Congress violaetd non-delegation doctrine (cannot delegate congressional authority)

2006 Rapanos v US

CWA issue

wetland on property was filled in

determined Waters of the United States status

2007 MA v EPA

reconsideration of greenhouse gases to be regulated under CAA

2018 USFWS vs Weyerhauser

USFWS attempted to enact ESA

lumber company wanted to use potential habitat for endangered frog

2022 WV v EPA

EPA wanted to regulate more GHG emissions that allowed under acts from the 90s (Clean Power Plan CPP)

WV did not want to comply with the CPP

court ruled against EPA, that EPA had overstepped

example of states influencing national policy through the courts

Environmental Policy Administration

How are environmental rules made?

Congress passes legislation that requires rules to be made

Agencies (with power delegated from Congress) write specific rules and regulations by interpreting legislation

Power of the agencies is tested in court

Adminstrative Procedure Act (APA)

Rulemaking Process:

Congress passes broad framework

Agency decides specifics

Rulemaking also occurs from public petition and political pressure from WH and Congress

Published in CFR

Adjudication procress:

challenges the procedural aspect of a rule

courts hear specific cases to determine how regulations are interpreted

Citizens v Volpe:

Sec. of Transport. said they considered other routes but provided no evidence

DC Court asked agency to do in-depth review and provide evidence

VT Yankee Nuclear v. NRDC

Changing of rules:

agency heads reversing prior policies

executive orders

not covered by AP and can be easilty reversed

EO 12898 - Federal Actions to address environmental justice in minority and low-income populations

Chevron vs NRDC

bundling stationary sources into plantwide regulation

SCOTUS upheld the EPA definition of a plant-wide 'stationary source'

concluded that Congress definition of stationary source was not obvious from statute, and that EPA's interpretation was reasonable, and therefore the court must defer to the agency

Non-legislative Rules:

not subject to APA requirements

eg. publication and guidance documents

agencies can issue these without public notice

Enforcement:

EPA initiates civil enforcement cases and environmental crime cases

EPA conducts inspections that lead to civil actoins

trend of fewer enforcement actions over the years

Can coordinate enforcement initiatives

work with state agencies

Enforcement Process:

detections (violation knowledge, monitoring)

Civil enforcement brought by EPA (fines and penalties)

criminal enforcement by EPA

citizens suits

SLAPP lawsuits

National Environmental Policy Act

Requires all federal agencies to conduct Environmental Impact Statement on anything with significant effects to the environment.

Council on Environmental Quality created under White House.
Has no enforcement, but brings suits against agencies for violating NEPA.

EPA Office of Federal Activities
US Institute of Environmental Conflict Resolution

NEPA EIS required for all major federal actions.

If is unclear whether it's major action, perform EA

Any projects that require EIA:

draft EIS, make available for public comment

finalize EIS

Exclusions:

agency actions already determined to not cause significant environmental effects

others

Environmental Assessment

determine whether there is sufficient evidence to require an EIS

#### Feb 14, 2024

NEPA

Environmental Impact Statements

EA

Draft EIS

Final EIS

ROD

EA

determine whether there is enough environmental impact to warrant an EIS, public input not required

discuss need for proposal

list alternative courses of action

environmental impacts of proposed actions and alternatives

listing of agencies and persons consulted

either 1) Finding of No Significant Impact or 2) prceed to prepare EIS

EIS

quantify the impact on the "quality of the human environment"

discuss proposed action and need for proposal

baseline of affected environment

range of REASONABLE alternatives including the no action alternative

environmental impacts of proposed actions and all alternatives

other info: environmental mitigation plans, other compliance

Notice of Intent (NOI)

published in Federal Registrer stating agency's intent to prepare an EIS

lists proposed actions

scope of the issue (key stakeholders, problem boundary, etc)

alternative actions

Direct Impact

effects by the proposed action at the same time and placeIndirect Impact

secondary effects from the proposed action (time- or location-lag)Cumulative Impact

sum of direct and indirect impacts over lifespan of project

Sectors considered

Ecological

Aesthetic, Historic, Cultural

Economic, Social

Health

#### Feb 19, 2024

Direct and Indirect Environmental Impacts

Cumulative Impacts

sum of impacts from Past, Present, and Future actions in ADDITION to the proposed project impacts

Geographic boundaries for cumulative effects analysis

depends on scale of affected resource

EIS Rating System

one rating on whether the EIS accurately assessed impact:LO. Lack of ObjectionEC. Environmental ConcernsEO. Environmenal ObjectionsEU. Environmentally Unsatisfactory

one rating on the adequecy of draft EIS

Adequate

Insufficient Information

Inadequate

Bush - 1990 US Global Climate Change Research Program

Stabilization Triangle

Marginal Abatement Cost

State Policy Initiatives for addressing climate change

Renewable Portfolio Standards

Decoupling

providing incentives so that power companies make some profit while switching to less profitable energy sources

Energy Efficiency Resource Standards

improving efficiency of grid

long-term benefit to company and consumers

reduce overall demand

reduce energy consumption

Climate Action Plan

Cap-and-Trade Programs

total cap for emissions set by state

emission credits can be traded on the market

Regional Greenhosue Gas Initiative (RGGI)

cap-and-trade program in NE

only focused on power sector

Emission leakage:

pricing carbon just moves the power industry to other states where elecricity is cheaper

Boone Community Climate Action Plan

2050 net zero goal for entire town community
2040 net zero for municipal operations

App State (Boone Campus) is under the Boone CAP

they also have their own CAP

ICLEI - Clearpath estimates emissions

Town requires ~200kWh yearly
aka 40 MW generation capacity

Stormwater Management

Two main points that are addressed in water policy:

Water Quantity (flow volume)

Water Quality (contaminant removal)

Nature-based Solutions (NBS)

planning, design, environmental management and engineering practices that emphasize natural features/processes into the built environment to promote aaptation and resilience

Watershed scale

Stormwater Ponds
Floodplain Restoration

Neighborhood/Site scale

Rain garden
Vegetated swales
Green roof
Rainwater harvesting
Permeable pavement
Tree canopy
Tree trenches
Green streets
